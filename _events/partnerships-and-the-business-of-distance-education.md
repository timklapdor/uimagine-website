  bio: |-
    Sir John Daniel’s work has been recognised with national honours by the three countries in which he has lived: France – Ordre des Palmes Académiques: Chevalier ‘pour services rendus à la culture française (en Ontario)’ (1986); Officier: ‘pour services rendus à la culture française (au Royaume-Uni)’ (1991); United Kingdom – Knight Bachelor ‘for services to higher education’ (1994); Canada – Officer of the Order of Canada ‘for his advancement of open learning and distance education in Canada and around the world’ (2013).

    He was educated at Christ’s Hospital and then obtained a First in Metallurgy at Oxford and the Doctorat ès-Sciences Physiques at the University of Paris. Later he demonstrated his commitment to lifelong learning by taking 25 years to complete a part-time Master’s degree in Educational Technology at Sir George Williams/Concordia University. The internship for that programme, which took him to the UK Open University in 1972, was a life-changing experience. He saw the future of higher education and wanted to be part of it.

    This quest took him on an international odyssey with appointments at the École Polytechnique, Université de Montréal (professeur assistant/ agrégé, 1969-73); Télé-université, Université du Québec (Directeur des Études, 1973-77); Athabasca University (Vice-President for Learning Services, 1978-80); Concordia University (Vice-Rector, Academic, 1980- 84); Laurentian University (President/Recteur, 1984-90); The Open University (Vice-Chancellor, 1990-2001); UNESCO (Assistant Director- General for Education, 2001-04); and the Commonwealth of Learning (President, 2004-12).

    He now works on various international projects: as Education Master in the Beijing DeTao Masters Academy, China; Senior Advisor to Academic Partnerships International; Research Associate at Contact North | Contact Nord; and Chair, pro bono, of the UWC (United World Colleges) International Board.

    Among Sir John’s 350+ publications are his books Mega-Universities and Knowledge Media: Technology Strategies for Higher Education (Kogan Page, 1996) and Mega-Schools, Technology and Teachers: Achieving Education for All (Routledge, 2010).

    Sir John is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund Hall, Oxford University (1990), the College of Preceptors (1997) and the Commonwealth of Learning (2002). He won the Symons Medal of the Association of Commonwealth Universities in 2008 and his 32 honorary degrees are from universities in 17 countries.

  bio: Dr Gaye Krebs is Courses Director in the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences
    and was the team leader in the design, development and introduction in 2015 of
    the new Bachelor of Veterinary Technology. In Australia the current nationally
    accepted qualification for veterinary support staff is a Certificate IV in Veterinary
    Nursing. This vocational level of education is below the international standards
    (for veterinary paraprofessionals) of the USA, Canada and UK. CSU saw the opportunity
    to establish a niche market for better prepared, work-ready veterinary paraprofessionals.
    Industry feedback was that graduates from the Bachelor of Veterinary Technology
    should have as a base line all of the skills and competencies of a veterinary
    nurse. Consequently we articulated (from the Certificate IV in Veterinary Nursing)
    and integrated courses offered by Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE (GOTAFE), with
    teaching of the new degree the responsibility of both CSU and GOTAFE.

    education provider (Dimension Data) developed a range of unique training products
    that eventually contributed $10.4ml in revenue. Managed all facets of the introduction
    of these products from development of the initial concept right through until
    the products were successfully established in the marketplace. As an executive
    in Telstra learning he was selected to head up a team to review all training activities

## **SCOPE & OVERVIEW**

The growth of university partnerships, particularly public- private partnerships (PPPs) has created new opportunities for institutions to leverage increased capacity, minimise financial and reputational risks and increase their competitive advantage in a rapidly increasing marketplace. Moreover, institutions with quality online and distance learning capacity are leveraging new options for building innovative new approaches to strategic alliances and collaborations.

This Think Tank will explored existing CSU partnership models through an open dialogue of the strengths and limitations of current partnerships. The focus of this Think Tank was on Open and Distance Learning (ODL) partnerships given CSU’s increasing (66%+ students) growth and positioning in the online market. Two global experts also shared their unique experiences for building sustainable partnerships that result in value-added benefits for the institution and its partners.  Discussions took place around the key questions related to CSU’s partnership strategy in the online and distance learning market including:

1. What are the parameters for CSU engagement in external public and private ODL partnerships?  What type of organisations does CSU want to partner? Why?
2. What criteria will be used to assess the viability of potential ODL partnerships?
3. What are the priority KPIs that CSU will target to assess and measure partnership effectiveness?
4. What are the key risk-reward scenarios driving CSU partnerships?
5. What are the value propositions for CSU and for potential partners for various partnership scenarios in ODL?
